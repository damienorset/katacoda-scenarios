This lab will guide you through a end to end ML use case from vizualizing data to deploying the trained model to make predicitons.
Based on a Google github repository (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst.git) you'll learn :
1. how to explore a dataset with python libraries
2. how to split a full dataset into a train and eval one
3. how to use canned (prebuillt) models : dnn, wide&deep
4. how to preprocess the dataset with Apache Beam
5. how to train at large scale with CMLE
6. and how to deloy the trained model to make predictions
